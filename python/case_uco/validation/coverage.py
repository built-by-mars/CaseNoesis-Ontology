"""Closed-world concept coverage checking for CASE/UCO/extension graphs.

SHACL validation only evaluates shapes whose target classes exist, so a graph
that types nodes with classes (or uses properties) that no supported ontology
declares can pass ``case_validate`` silently. This module closes that gap:
every class and property IRI used by a submitted graph must be declared in
the CASE/UCO core ontologies or in a supported extension ontology, otherwise
the graph is rejected with guidance to draft a change proposal or add the
concept to an extension ontology.

Three layers of checking:

1. **Declared-term membership** — every class/property must be declared in a
   supported ontology (core, extension, pinned upper-ontology registry, or a
   foundational W3C namespace).
2. **Exact upper-ontology terms** — profiled upper ontologies (BFO, gUFO,
   PROV-O, OWL-Time, GeoSPARQL, FOAF, ORG, PROF) are validated against the
   pinned term registry (``upper_ontology_registry.json``) instead of
   whole-namespace acceptance, so fabricated terms inside a profiled
   namespace fail. **Strict mode requires an explicit profile selection**
   (CQ-29): ``profiles=None`` / empty authorizes *zero* upper profiles —
   upper-namespace terms fail as ``profile_not_selected`` rather than
   silently accepting the full registry. Recipe validation always passes
   ``profiles=[...]`` so exemplars keep working.
3. **RDF role awareness** — declarations are tracked by role (class,
   property, shape, individual). A declared class used as a predicate, or a
   declared property used as an ``rdf:type`` class, is reported as a role
   mismatch rather than silently accepted. OWL punning (e.g. the ATT&CK
   ``uco-action:Technique`` metaclass pattern where a term is both an
   ``owl:Class`` and an individual) is supported: any term declared as a
   class may be used as an ``rdf:type`` object.

**Same-bundle coverage (CQ-27/CQ-28):** when a ``ResolvedValidationBundle``
is passed via ``bundle=...``, declared extension/profile terms are loaded
*only* from that bundle's exact resources (same subset/full mode and
fingerprint as SHACL). Coverage must not accept terms from full-manifest
files that SHACL never loaded.

Foundational W3C vocabulary policy: terms in RDF, RDFS, OWL, XSD, SHACL,
SKOS, Dublin Core, and Web Annotation namespaces are accepted by namespace
because they are governed by W3C specifications outside this SDK and are
imported wholesale by the supported ontologies.

Once an extension ontology (or the upstream ontology) declares the concept,
the same graph passes without further changes — the declared-term set is
recomputed whenever the ontology files on disk change (the cache key includes
a content fingerprint of every ontology file, so a term added, removed, or
renamed during the same server process is picked up on the next check).
