"""Central resolver for extension/ontology directories (v1.19.0).

The SDK vendors ontologies in two roots:

- ``ontology/`` — upstream-maintained ontologies synced from external
  sources: CASE and UCO (git submodules), plus the CAC Ontology, the
  Adversary Engagement Ontology (AEO), and SOLVE-IT. These are published
  by their own projects and only *mirrored* here.
- ``extensions/`` — SDK-developed extension ontologies (toolcap,
  attack-technique, rico, legalproc, cryptoinv, drugs, weapons, ...) and
  candidate extensions produced by the learning lifecycle.

Every module that needs ``<root>/<name>/manifest.json`` (or any other file
inside an extension directory) must resolve the directory through this
module instead of hardcoding ``project_root / "extensions"`` so that both
roots are searched uniformly. Name-based APIs (``CASE_UCO_EXTENSIONS=cac``)
are unaffected by which root an extension lives in.
